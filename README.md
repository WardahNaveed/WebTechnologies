# helloWorld
In this project, you will set up a &quot;Hello world&quot; repository. No complex coding is
required for this exercise. Your goal here is to master all of the tools and best
practices you learned about in previous steps. You will be using them in all projects
and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!
IMPORTANT NOTE: Read all requirements before you start building your project.
